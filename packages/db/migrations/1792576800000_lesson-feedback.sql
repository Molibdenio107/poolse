-- POOLSE-116: a student's feedback after a lesson, from the family app.
--
-- One row per (lesson, student). It is admissible only for a lesson that
-- happened and that the student was in: the session is not cancelled, it has
-- ended, and the register marks the student `present`. The window is the
-- lesson's day plus `lesson_feedback_window()`, judged on `club_today()`.
--
-- **Keyed on the session and the student, not on `attendance.id`.** The
-- ticket hung it off the attendance row, but clearing a mark DELETEs that
-- row (`saveRegisterIn`), so a foreign key would make an instructor's
-- correction fail over a family's comment, and the register must never be
-- gated by what a family wrote. "Only where present" is this trigger's job
-- instead, at the moment of writing; a mark changed afterwards leaves the
-- words where they are, because they were written about a lesson the child
-- was marked in at the time.
--
-- Not deleted, ever: no DELETE grant. The office archives (the bin restores),
-- and retention anonymises (mood kept, words and author cleared).
