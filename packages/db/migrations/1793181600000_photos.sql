-- Photographs that can be uploaded — Rui, 28-10-2026.
--
-- Three kinds of face, three homes:
--   * your own: Clerk holds it (it is the avatar at the top right), written
--     through the API like the name, and cached in app_user.cached_avatar_url;
--   * a staff member with no login: membership.photo_file_id, uploaded by the
--     office (a person with a login sets their own, as with their name);
--   * a student: student.photo_file_id, uploaded by the office and shown only
--     while a photo consent is granted and not withdrawn. The consent is read
--     where the id is read (PHOTO_KEY in students.repository.ts) and again when
--     the file is opened, so a withdrawal hides it everywhere at once.
--
-- `student.photo_storage_key` was reserved in 1787821200000 for an object key
-- and never written; it gives way to a reference into stored_file, the one
-- registry of what is in the bucket. apply_retention clears the new column.
